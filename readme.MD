# Bubble Sort

> For this project, we created two **sorting algorithms** that use the [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) method.

This side-by-side comparative method is seen in the GIF image below.

> The second bubble sort method sorts an array of strings by the length of each element using the "yield" keyword and a code block.

## Built With
